# Capstone-Project-BAR.IO

Capstone project of UNO for Bar.IO

## Application

The object of this app is to be able to find the liquid level of a bottle. It is to ease the troubles of taking inventory of partially filled bottles.


## Release Notes

**Starting version: 1.0**

This app can currently identify and detect a bottle and approximate the liquid level. It currently has no other features to work with.

**1.1**

Add a container to the bottom of the screen for future features, such as confirmation and a list of current inventory.

Add a list for items to be added onto. Future updates will be implementing calculations of the app itself in a item to be added into the list.

Worked on by all three team memebers in group sessions. 

Nikolas worked on fine tuning the AI problems. 

Cole worked on the list implmentation and container. 

Tait worked on documentation.
