# Capstone-Project-BAR.IO

Capstone project of UNO for Bar.IO

## Application

The object of this app is to be able to find the liquid level of a bottle. It is to ease the troubles of taking inventory of partially filled bottles. For the purpose of this project, our sponsor wanted us to work on the design of the UI and make the application as a demonstration that he could use as a proof of concept.

This application is used by running through the XCode developer enviroment. Once the swift code is loaded into Apple XCode, you can then deploy to an iPhone and run the application.


## Release Notes

**Starting version: 1.0**

This app can currently identify and detect a bottle and approximate the liquid level. It currently has no other features to work with.

**1.1**

Add a container to the bottom of the screen for future features, such as confirmation and a list of current inventory.

Add a list for items to be added onto. Future updates will be implementing calculations of the app itself in a item to be added into the list.

Worked on by all three team memebers in group sessions. 

Nikolas worked on fine tuning the AI problems. 

Cole worked on the list implmentation and container. 

Tait worked on documentation. 

**1.2**

Added a loading bar

Processing wheel.

List of elements

Images for list of items

Enhanced UI Design.

We worked as a group in this. 

**1.3 - Final Milestone - Project Done**

Added functionality for the "scan" bottle into a list for demonstrations

Made the scanning feel smoother and better for the user experience

Cleaned up the user interface

Bug Fixes - Bottle continues to "scan" after leaving view

Will view 3 predetermined bottles and act as a it is scanning into a list

We worked as a group in this. 

## Branches

Each branch shows where the project was at during each code milestone 

The experimental branch has code for possible barcode scanning but sponsoror did not require and is nonfunctional
